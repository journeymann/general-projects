Atonement in the Old Testament<br>
<br>
The Hebrew verb ‘to atone’ (kaphar) means ‘cover’, so the noun ‘atonement’ (kippurim pl.) is a form of ‘covering’. The most usual form of the word in the Old Testament is kipper (piel form, causative form, of kaphar) which means to ’cause to be covered’, ‘make covering for’.<br>
<br>
Lev.5:18 "And the priest shall make covering (KJV atonement) for him on account of his ignorance."<br>
<br>
This is all ‘atonement’ means. It’s just a way of translating the Hebrew idea of ‘covering’ sins as an idiom for ‘forgiving’ sins. Although the idea of ‘cover’ can also be used in ‘covering’, appeasing anger:
<br>
Prov.16:14 "A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,and a wise man will appease it."<br>
<br>
The word “appease” in the above is the same as “covering” or “atonement” in the 69 OT verses which traditionally contain that word. Prov.16:14 shows, uncomfortably perhaps, the basic meaning of the word in human context. Though the “appeasing” of a king, and the “covering” for sin are somewhat different, it also shows that “covering” is not simply about “hiding” sins, but fixing. <br>
The word atonement was first used in a translation of the Bible by William Tyndale later in the 1500s, possibly while in exile in Antwerp. It was one of the many words Tyndale had to invent in order to convey the sense of the Hebrew words he was translating into the English transtation of the bible.<br>
And the basic concept of atonement is covering for sins coming from merciful God, not an angry God being appeased or bought off. God is working in our lives to bring us back into friendship with Himself. <br>
<br>
Gen. 6:14 "Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch." <br>
<br>
It is well known that the first time a word or concept occurs in the scriptures, it is very important and demands our attention.<br>
The Hebrew word ‘kippor’ translated here as 'pitch' was used to make Noah's ark water-tight and to keep it from sinking, thus allowing it to survive the diluge. It was a very critical component of the whole act of saving Noah (mankind) because without it they would not survive. The Hebrew ‘kippor’ later carries the concept of ‘cover’ and ‘covering’ and ‘to atone’ as in the forgiveness of sins as discussed above. Also, the lid of the Ark of the Covenant, or the Mercy Seat, was also called ‘kippor’ in the Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
Because of the atonement and through our faith in Jesus, we have a right relationship with God. We are His friends, not His enemies; and that changes everything.<br>
